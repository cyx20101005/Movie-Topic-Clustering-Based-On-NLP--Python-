# Movie Topic Clustering Based On NLP (Python)
 
- Developed algorithms to cluster hundreds of unlabeled IMDB movies into groups and explored their latent semantic structuresâ€¨
- Preprocessed data by tokenizing synopsis, stemming and removing stop-words and non-letters, and utilized TF-IDF to extract text features
- Trained unsupervised learning models like K-means and LDA to cluster data into 5 groups which have a lower sum of square error than 4 groups and less training time than 6 groups
- Identified hidden topics and keywords of each synopsis under 5 clusters and calculated synopsis similarity
- Visualized training results by dimensionality reduction using PCA and cluster distribution
